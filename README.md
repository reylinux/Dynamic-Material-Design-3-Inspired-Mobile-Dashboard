# Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard
**INTRODUCTION**

Welcome to my custom **Material Design 3‚Äìinspired mobile dashboard** ‚Äî a project born from my passion for clean, intuitive interfaces and rich color customization.

This project is the result of my passion for crafting clean, intuitive UIs with a focus on **dynamic color customization**. Inspired by **Google's Material You** design language, the dashboard adapts accent colors across all elements ‚Äî while keeping usability and clarity at the core.

Whether it's controlling lights, viewing sensor data, or managing automations, every element is designed to be **intuitive at a glance**, without sacrificing personality or flexibility.

If you love dashboards that are both **aesthetically pleasing and highly functional**, this project might inspire your next setup.

**üß± Behind the Scenes: Theming & Code Optimization**

To enable the dynamic theming system, you'll need to set up an [input_select](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Input%20Select.txt) helper along with a few [template sensors](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Dynamic%20Theme%20Sensor.txt) that drive the color mapping logic. I recommend using a popup card as the interface for selecting accent colors ‚Äî it keeps the dashboard clean while allowing easy interaction.

It's also worth noting that I‚Äôve decluttered most of the repetitive card definitions using [decluttering-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/decluttering-card). This not only streamlined the configuration but also reduced over 3,000 lines of YAML, significantly improving maintainability and performance.

# üå§Ô∏è Homepage: Alerts, Climate & Presence
<img width="1600" height="1440" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/263ef5b6-e7ed-404e-8817-52844e4ced22" />

The homepage includes:

- [Alarm & notification indicators](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Alarm%20&%20Notification%20Indicators.txt)
- [Weather Forecast with Buttons](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Weather%20Forecast%20Buttons)
- [Three-button color selector (Home, Environment, Active)](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Three%20Buttons%20Selectors.txt)
- [Climate control section with indoor/outdoor temperature](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Climate%20Control.txt)

  _For the outdoor weather condition icon, you will need this [template sensor](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Weather%20Condition%20Icon%20Sensor) to get it working._
- [Room occupancy & presence sensor toggles (sliders)](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Room%20Occupancy%20%26%20Presence%20Sensors%20Toggle)  
- A hidden calendar beneath the [navbar](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Navbar.txt), accessible on interaction  
- [Indoor temperature](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Indoor%20Temperature%20Card) & humidity cards shift hue based on the current reading (from violet ‚Üí red).
- A dedicated "Currently Active" section shows lights, switches, fans, music, and any active automation in real-time.

If you‚Äôd like to copy the **full code for the three-button color selector** and the supporting components beneath it, you can find it [here](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Button%20Full%20Code.txt)

# üè† Room Overview, Cameras & Weather Panel

- Each [room card](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Room%20Card%20Example.txt) shows light toggles, climate status, and door/window sensors ‚Äî with background color reflecting room temperature.
- [Camera views](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Camera%20Example.txt) include nearby light toggles for quick control.
- A full weather panel includes [current conditions](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Weather%20Status.txt), warnings, multi-day forecasts, and a live [Windy radar](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Weather%20Radar.txt) embed. You'll need to get the URL from the Windy embed [here](https://embed.windy.com/config/map) and grab the URL within the quotes from the src section and put it in the iframe card.
- Earthquake, volcano, and similar alerts are displayed using dedicated pop-up cards.

# üß≠ Tabbed Navigation per Room
<img width="3200" height="2880" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/173aa636-4b7a-4812-ac6c-3e5f3136fd75" />

Rooms are broken into tabs for clear navigation:

- **Room**: Lights and devices
- **Stats**: Temperature and humidity
- **Active**: Open doors/windows, speakers, switches

I use [decluttering_templates](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Decluttering%20Templates.txt) and [button_card_template](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Button%20Card%20Templates.txt) here. Make sure to have the code on top of your dashboard YAML to get them to work. Full code can be found [here](https://github.com/reylinux/Dynamic-Material-Design-3-Inspired-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/Living%20Room%20Example.txt)

# üé® Scene Selector, Color Palette & Server Info
